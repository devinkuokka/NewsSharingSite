Creative Portion:
- formatted the website in css to have header, footer and side navigation bar on pages
- when signing up, users are required to confirm password as a safety measure
- usernames are remembered and provide suggestions when entering
- passwords are hidden while being entered and are not remembered
- navigation bar:
	- always has a logout option
	- always has a go back button which takes you back to the previous page preserving the story_id or comment_id
	- these buttons navigaet using javascript
- adding a comment box to a story is on the same page as the story for user ease and automatically updates story page upon submitting comment
- all titles and comments (the required feilds for stories and comments respectively) check that a blank string (i.e. "    ") is not entered 
  both when originally submitted and when editted
- story link is hyperlinked so you can open link without copying it into url
- edit story and edit comment pages send back to respective story page and comment page with updates upon submission
- delete story and delete comment buttons send user back to respective newsfeed and story page with updates upon submission
- can click comments to link to 'comment page':
	- gives edit and delete options (only if user is author)
	- selected comment name can be clicked again to 'close comment page' and go back to story page
	- other comments on 'comment page' can be clicked to take to their respective comment pages
- attempted to add subcomments (code is commented out on commentPage.php
	- having problems connecting to table and did not finish figuring out why...
	- would have printed subcomments when 'comment page' was selected (that was the point of making a comment page)
